# Secret Agents Scratch 2

This is a Scratch 2 implementation based on the existing Secret Agent Chat project which uses Python.

In this project you will learn how to make an uncrackable code to send short messages between two secret agents! You will learn:

- how to make a code known as a **one-time-pad**, 
- how to **encode** a short message so that it looks like gibberish, 
- how to turn the encoded message into **Morse code**, and 
- how to **decode** the message at the other end.
